Explain what inheritance is.

Inheritance in Java works with classes. When a new class is based on another one it is inheriting it. The based on class is callled the 
super class. The new class inherits everything from the super class and all of the methods can be used with the new class.

Explain what polymorphism is.
Polymorphism is when an class which inherits another has the same method. This method then uses @override to be used instead of the original one.
By this way you have a base method which then gets changed accordingly to the inheriting class.
